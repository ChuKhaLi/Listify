# Interview questions
1. What are examples of the types of projects you have deployed to Azure?
- Only Web Apps, and they are my pet projects.

2. How do you classify your senior-ness as a developer? What are your development strengths?
- I am a senior developer. I have 5 years of experience in software development. I am good at C#, .NET Core, Angular, SQL Server, Redis, Mqtt.

3. What are your top 1-2 favorite editor(s)?
- Visual Studio Code : text editor
- Visual Studio : IDE

4. Have you ever done a pull request?
- Yes, I have done a pull request in Github/Gitlab/Azure.

5. Have you ever had a chance to use TDD? Have you found it to be helpful? If so, when does it work best
for you?
- Not yet in my current project, but I've tried to make unit test for Angular project.

6. Have you been given the opportunity to use tools like ReSharper? What did you like about it?
- Yes, I've used it during I was a student. It's very helpful to find bugs and refactor code.

7. Do you prefer working directly with the business people? Or do you find it's best to have a go-between?
- I have no problem working directly with PO/PE/BA people. I am working on a 2-week sprint, so I can talk to them every day.

8. Have you ever used web.config transformations? If not, do you know what they are good for?
- Yes, I did know it can transform config between environments, for example: remove debug attribute, replace connection string. 
However, in my current project, we config it directly.

9. Can you tell me anything about `slots` in terms of Azure? If not, based on what you just googled, how would you use them in your next Azure project?
- I know that we can deploy to a slot, then swap it with production slot. It's useful when we want to deploy a new version to production, but we don't want to make it live immediately.

10. Can you explain what DevOps and/or continuous integration is, and some of the benefits?
- DevOps play a middle role between developers and operations. It's a culture, not a tool. It's about collaboration, communication, and integration.
- CI/CD is a process to build, test, and deploy code automatically. It's a tool to help DevOps. We can then commit code and the tool will build and deploy it automatically.


11. Are you technology agnostic or are you pretty strict when it comes to things like Mac vs Windows, or AWS
vs Azure?
- I am technology agnostic. I don't mind working on Mac or Windows. Currently I am working on a Windows machine, mainly because I am using .NET Core and Visual Studio.

12. What are some of your more advanced SQL querying abilities (i.e., like what keywords or commands, etc)?
- I can write SQL query: select, join, group by, order by, store procedure views

13. Do you happen to know what TypeScript is and why itâ€™s gotten popular? How does it differ from JS?
- Typescript is a superset of Javascript. It's a typed language, like C#, so it's easier to debug. You can write valid Js code in Typescript.

14. Can you explain the diff b/t relational databases and NoSQL? What are some NoSQL platforms that you have familiarity with?
- Relational databases are good for structured data, like tables. NoSQL is good for unstructured data, like JSON. I have used MongoDB, but I don't have much experience with it.

15. Can you explain GPG, SSL or public/private key encryption?
- It is asymmetric encryption. It's used to encrypt and decrypt data. It's also used to verify the identity of a person or a website. It uses 2 keys, private key and public key. When using to encrypt data, we use the public key to encrypt data, then the receiver can use the private key to decrypt data. When using to verify identity, we do the reverse thing, use the private key to sign data, then the receiver can use the public key to verify the signature.

16. Do you know anything about "secure coding" practices?
- Yes, I know about OWASP Top 10. It's a list of the most critical web application security risks. In fact, I am fixing some of them in my current project.

17. Can _you_ authenticate to GitHub using SSH?
- Yes, I can. Using this command: ssh -T git@github.com. You need to generate a key pair first, then add the public key to your Github account. I prefer using Git GUI tool to do that.

18. Can you explain what REST sorta kinda means?
- REST is an architectural style for designing web services. It's a set of rules to design APIs. It's stateless, client-server, cacheable, layered system, etc.
- Usually, we use HTTP methods to implement REST APIs. For example: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

19. How enthusiastic would you be if we asked to pay you to take some training courses on Udemy?
- I am very enthusiastic about learning new things. I am taking a course on Udemy right now.

20. How many of these platforms / languages / frameworks do you have experience with?
Node 
Typescript 
Angular 
SQL 
Excel 
Windows
Jasmine 
Docker
.NET C# NUnit
SQL Server
MongoDB 
Azure
